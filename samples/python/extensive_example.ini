#
# Template MTT configuration file for MTT users.  The intent
# for this template file is to establish at least some loose
# guidelines for what MTT users should be running
# before committing changes to the OMPI repository. This file is not
# intended to be an exhaustive sample of all possible fields and
# values that MTT offers. Each developer will undoubtedly have to
# edit this template for their own needs (e.g., pick compilers to use,
# etc.), but this file provides a baseline set of configurations that
# we intend for you to run. 

#For command line options enter pyclient/pymtt.py --help

# Sample usages:
#   pyclient/pymtt.py --skip-sections SECTION --verbose /path/to/INI/file
#   
#   To combine INI files:
#   cat developer.ini trivial.ini >> combined.ini
#   pyclient/pymtt.py --verbose /path/to/INI/file/combined.ini
#   OR cat developer.ini trivial.ini | pyclient/pymtt.py --verbose
