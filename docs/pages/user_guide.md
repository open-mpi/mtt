# User Guide

First check out the [MTT Overview](https://open-mpi.github.io/mtt/), [Getting Started](https://open-mpi.github.io/mtt/pages/environment_setup.html), [Plugins](https://open-mpi.github.io/mtt/pages/plugins_docs.html) and [INI](https://open-mpi.github.io/mtt/pages/ini_docs.html) guides to get familiar with MTT.

MTT users need to be cautious and ensure not to create an INI file that will take days (or weeks!) to complete. Use the "--print-section-time" option to the MTT client to see how long each phase is taking to help tune your INI file.

## INI file setup

All INI file parameters can be overridden at the command-line. This is helpful in avoiding the need for numerous INI files that are virtually identical.   
INI files can also be chained together on the command line. For example:    

pyclient/pymtt.py --verbose ../INIfiles/a.ini ../INIfiles/b.ini ../INIfiles/c.ini  
 
The chained files will work with each other so you can make each section of the INI file independently if you want to and then mix and match them. This can help avoid the problem of making INI files that take forever to run.

### Example INI files

Example INI files can be found in the mtt/samples/python directory. 'ompi_snapshot_seq.ini' is a short example version of an INI file that is a good place to start building your own. 'extensive_example' covers most of the possible plugins and values that are available. Since custom plugins can be used with MTT they cannot all be covered here.

### INI Section MTTDefaults
MTTDefaults phase - Some general settings for the run.

##### OPTIONS

### INI Section BIOS
COMING SOON

### INI Section Firmware

### INI Section Provision

### INI Section Profile
Profile phase - Runs a plugin that gets system information.
**This phase is required.**

##### Example usage
[Profile:Installed]

### INI Section MiddlewareGet
MiddlewareGet phases - can have multiple phases using a colon and unique ending identifier [MiddlewareGet:UniqueID]

This isn't a required phase - if the purpose of this test is to simply stress the physical system, then one can skip this phase by adding SKIP to the title. To avoid reprocessing sections add ASIS to the title. To run using an already installed version of MPI use the AlreadyInstalled plugin.

## Capabilities of MTT

### Accessing environment variables from within an INI file

One useful feature of MTT is the ability of accessing outside environment variables from within an INI file. This enables MTT tests to respond to dynamic input fron the environment.

To access environment variables, use this syntax:

```
${ENV:ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE}
```

MTT will directly substitute the value into the location of the INI file you specified.

If an environment variable does not exist, MTT will warn the user and MTT will exit with an error.

### Accessing the MTT log from within an INI file

Another useful feature of MTT is the ability of accessing results and data from previous stages in the execution of later stages.

To access the MTT log, you must use this syntax:

```
${LOG:Profile_Installed.status}
```

The above example is accessing the status of the stage `[Profile:Installed]`. Colons (":") are substituted for underscores ("_"), and dots (".") are used as delimiters for accessing different parts of the data.

You can use the LogInterpolationDebug plugin to view all the contents of the MTT log in the same syntax you would use to access the same data.

This is how to include the LogInterpolationDebug plugin within your INI file:

```
[Reporter:LogInterpolationDebug]
plugin = LogInterpolationDebug
```

After including this plugin in your INI file, the output of your test will include something similar to this to help you determine the correct syntax to use to access the MTT log.

```
=========================================================================
START EXECUTING [Reporter:TextFile] start_time=2020-01-06 19:17:00.505503
=========================================================================
OPTIONS FOR SECTION: Reporter:TextFile
  plugin = TextFile
Executing plugin TextFile
LOG Interpolation Debugging Tool
${LOG:MTTDefaults} = { ....................... }
${LOG:MTTDefaults.keys} = [ ....... ]
${LOG:MTTDefaults.keys.length} = 7
${LOG:MTTDefaults.keys.size} = 7
${LOG:MTTDefaults.keys.0} = section
${LOG:MTTDefaults.keys.1} = parameters
${LOG:MTTDefaults.keys.2} = status
${LOG:MTTDefaults.keys.3} = options
```

In the above output, notice what looks like `{ ... }` and `[ ... ]`. These are simply where the LogInterpolationDebug plugin is hiding JSON strings that contain data that you can also access directly, and the form in which you access the data directly is also displayed in the debug output.
